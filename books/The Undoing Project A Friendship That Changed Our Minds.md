# The Undoing Project A Friendship That Changed Our Minds
- It seemed to him that a big part of a consultant’s job was to feign total certainty about uncertain things.
- He suggested a new definition of the nerd: a person who knows his own mind well enough to mistrust it.
- “It was like a fish not knowing he is breathing water unless someone points it out,”
- offering a general impression of the recruit’s character. General impressions had been proven to be misleading, and so Danny wanted to avoid them. For
- “The nice thing about things that are urgent,” he liked to say, “is that if you wait long enough they aren’t urgent anymore.”
- “He’d walk into a room and decide he didn’t want anything to do with it and he would fade into the background and just vanish,” says Dona. “It was like a superpower. And it was absolutely an abnegation of social responsibility. He didn’t accept social responsibility—and so graciously, so elegantly, didn’t accept it.”
- “The big choices we make are practically random. The small choices probably tell us more about who we are. Which field we go into may depend on which high school teacher we happen to meet. Who we marry may depend on who happens to be around at the right time of life. On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic. That I became a psychologist is probably not very revealing. What kind of psychologist I am may reflect deep traits.”
- “We say ‘Turks fight like tigers’ and not ‘tigers fight like Turks.’ Since the tiger is renowned for its fighting spirit, it is used as the referent rather than the subject of the simile. The poet writes ‘my love is as deep as the ocean,’ not ‘the ocean is as deep as my love,’ because the ocean epitomizes depth.”
- “What is distance? Distance is symmetric. New York to Los Angeles has to be the same distance as Los Angeles to New York. And Amos said, ‘Okay, let’s test that.’” If, on some mental map, New York sits a certain distance from Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv must sit precisely the same distance from New York. Yet you needed only to ask people to see that it did not: New York was not as much like Tel Aviv as Tel Aviv was like New York.
- ‘The absence of a feature is a feature.’”
- Those features might become more or less noticeable; their prominence in the mind depended on the context in which they were perceived. And
- Two American college students in the United States might look at each other and see a total stranger; the same two college students on their junior year abroad in Togo might find that they are surprisingly similar: They’re both Americans!
- Thus, similarity has two faces: causal and derivative. It serves as a basis for the classification of objects, but is also influenced by the adopted classification.”
- That is, the mere act of classification reinforces stereotypes. If you want to weaken some stereotype, eliminate the classification.
- “it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them.” The other class Danny taught was about perception: how the senses interpreted and, occasionally, misled.
- “it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them.”
- might unlock the deep nature of the mechanism. “How do you understand memory?” he asked. “You don’t study memory. You study forgetting.”
- “How do you understand memory?” he asked. “You don’t study memory. You study forgetting.”
- The Hidden Persuaders,
- The psychologist Kurt Lewin had suggested persuasively that, rather than selling people on some change, you were better off identifying the reasons for their resistance, and addressing those.
