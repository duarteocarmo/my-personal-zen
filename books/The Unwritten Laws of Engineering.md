# The Unwritten Laws of Engineering
- the important thing is to state the essence of the matter as succinctly as possible first. On the other hand, there are times when it is important to add the pertinent background or other relevant facts to illuminate a simple statement. The trick is to convey the maximum of significant information in the minimum time, a valuable asset to anyone.
- Start at the bottom — the beginning — with the single most important fact, the one the audience must know before learning more. Often this is the conclusion itself. Progressively broaden the pyramid by constructing each sentence to build upon its predecessor. In this way you will be able to clearly explain even complicated, abstract concepts to anyone.
- If you do not know, say so, but also say, "I'll find out right away." If you are not certain, indicate the exact degree of certainty or approximation upon which your answer is based. A reputation for dependability and reliability can be one of your most valuable assets.
