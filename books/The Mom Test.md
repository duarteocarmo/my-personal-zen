# The Mom Test

- It’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our responsibility to find it. We do that by asking good questions.

- “What’s the last thing you did on it?” Get specific about examples in the past to get real, concrete data.

- Until we get specific, it always seems like a good idea.

- Mom was unable to lie to us because we never talked about our idea.

- If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to your customer conversations.

- The Mom Test: Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more

- "Talk me through the last time that happened."

- teacher may have told you that good stories are meant to “show, not tell”.

- "What else have you tried?"

- Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours.

- "How are you dealing with it now?"

- Rule of thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them.

- "Where does the money come from?"

- "Who else should I talk to?"

- "Is there anything else I should have asked?"

- Rule of thumb: People want to help you, but will rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so.

- There are three types of bad data: Compliments Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future) Ideas

- With the exception of industry experts who have built very similar businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not compliments.

- Them: “Oh, it’s really not that big of a deal for us. We kind of just ignore it.” The implications of the problem are non-existent so I’m not in the market for a solution.

- Symptoms (in the meeting): “Thanks!” “I’m glad you like it.” Symptoms (back at the office): “That meeting went really well.” “We’re getting a lot of positive feedback.” “Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea.”

- Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and entirely worthless.

- When someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or “never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Follow The Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried.

- The worst type of fluff-inducing question is, “Would you ever?” Of course they might. Someday. That doesn't mean they will. Fluff-inducing questions include: “Do you ever…” “Would you ever…” “What do you usually…” “Do you think you…” “Might you…” “Could you see yourself…”

- “Okay wow, so you are on top of things. I have like 200 right now. When’s the last time it totally fell apart for you?”

- Them: “Oh yeah, I remember that. I’m always kind of in a rush.” This is a nice bit of customer insight about their state of mind and circumstances when you’re trying to advertise to them. You: “Why don’t you download it now?” If someone’s being flaky, put them to a decision. If they don’t care enough to try solving their problem already, they aren’t going to care about your solution. Them: “I’ll do it next time.” Not a real problem.

- Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day.
