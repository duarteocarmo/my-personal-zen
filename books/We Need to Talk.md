# We Need to Talk

- “We used to talk, and people would listen.... People still gathered for the evening news. Mass culture was experienced en masse. A national conversation involved a large portion of the public talking about both important and frivolous stuff more or less at the same time.”

- Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.)

- Consider that for just a moment: the human race risks death in order to communicate more clearly. That’s how crucial language is to our species.

- communication, on the other hand, is quite profitable. Companies with leaders who are great communicators have nearly 50 percent higher returns than companies with unexceptional communicators at the helm.

- one of the more notable insights gleaned was that for every percentage point the company increased employee engagement through communication, stores saw a $100,000 annual increase in operating income.

- Some of the most effective salespeople, the ones who sell the most, are those who can listen and respond.

- good, balanced conversations are the ones who ultimately close the deal.

- It’s no surprise we have embraced texts and e-mails so readily. They’re expedient, and they allow us to retain more control and maintain some distance—physical and emotional—from the person on the other end. We can respond when and if we like. We can edit before we send. We can save the e-mail and prove, months later, that we did send that memo to the IT department, no matter what anyone says to the contrary.

- Don’t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them.”

- “get what we want” but also to advance as a species, we must reconnect with that which helps make us distinctly human. Technology will take us only so far; conversation can get us the rest of the way.

- “The ease of having ‘friends’ online might make people more likely to just tune out when they don’t feel like responding to others’ problems,”

- Empathy, at its most basic, is the ability to sense someone else’s feelings, to be aware of their emotional state, and to imagine their experience.

- half of online friendships are “non-reciprocal.”

- the two of you become in each other’s presence. The notion of doing nothing but spending time in each other’s company has, in a way, become a lost art.

- meaningful connection requires an investment of time.

- The average worker is interrupted every three minutes by e-mails, phone calls, texts, and social media.

- The researchers concluded that the presence of a cell phone hurt the quality of the conversation and the strength of the connection between the people talking. With a cell phone just sitting on a table in the room! Think of all the times you’ve sat down to have lunch with a friend or colleague and set your phone on the table.

- You might have felt virtuous because you didn’t pick it up to check your e-mail, but your ignored messages were still undermining your connection with the person sitting across from you.

- But the mess is often the best part.

- While I was writing this book, I used a planner (so analog!) to keep a running tally of my face-to-face conversations each day. Before this exercise, I estimated that I probably had three or four substantive conversations a day. But after tracking them carefully, it turned out that most days I was having perhaps one or two, sometimes none. It felt like more because I was communicating with people all day. But I was rarely talking with them.

- had to admit that when it came to conversation, maybe I wasn’t as smart as I thought I was.

- This is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned as a journalist: explain what you want and what you expect, and be honest.

- Taking a moment to think about your own expectations and sharing them with your conversational partner sets the stage for a productive exchange. It’s the equivalent of walking into the grocery store with a list instead of browsing through the aisles; you’re much more likely to get what you need and leave feeling satisfied.

- methods for creating a productive and fertile environment. One is to take a moment to consider how you’re feeling before you initiate an important discussion.

- Set the stage for a successful, enjoyable exchange by checking to make sure you’re both there to see the same show.

- “You’ve got to change a man’s heart before you can change his behavior.”

- They are: be curious, check your bias, show respect, stay the course, and end well.

- Putting yourself in someone else’s shoes is one way to do that.

- we approve of a single aspect of another person, we are more likely to judge them positively for other aspects. It takes just one common, important interest for us to find someone believable, trustworthy, and likeable.

- You can practice your empathy skills by watching a video of a public figure you don’t agree with. Watch a speech given by that person or an interview they’ve done, and focus on seeing that person as someone trying to accomplish something they believe to be good.

- But it’s absolutely essential if you want to respect that person.

- Perhaps they have made different decisions than you have, perhaps they’ve learned different lessons, but in their mind, they are doing their best.

- I try to practice my empathy skills in the car, which, for me, is very challenging. If someone cuts me off or runs a red light, my first instinct is to assume—and sometimes say aloud—terrible things about their intelligence and their upbringing. But what I’ve tried to do lately is imagine why they are in such a hurry or why they’re in such a bad mood. Instead of the expletives that I want to say, I’ll think, She’s probably had a bad day. Maybe she’s just trying to get home to see her kid. As a parent, I can empathize.

- Silence is preferable to flight.

- Not every conversation, or even most, will end with a hug and an epiphany. Sometimes, just learning what someone else thinks, without changing any minds, is more than enough. Take joy in the exchange, or, at the least, take satisfaction.

- end well.

- you end the conversation in a friendly and gracious way, you set the groundwork and the tone for future conversations.

- “National Sorry Day.”

- “so natural selection probably also gave us tools to help us restore important relationships after they have been damaged by conflict.”

- “While an apology cannot undo harmful past actions, if done sincerely and effectively, it can undo the negative effects of those actions.”

- In the video of the visit, you see Chancellor Brandt, stone-faced, dressed in a dark suit and overcoat, surrounded by officials and soldiers at attention, walking very slowly to the monument. When Brandt reaches the statue, he places a wreath of flowers in front of it and then, to the shock and surprise of everyone watching, he falls to his knees. He remained there for some time, in complete silence, kneeling with his hands clasped in front of him. All reports say the gesture was completely spontaneous and Brandt was simply overcome with the emotion of the moment. He signed the Treaty of Warsaw that day, which established Germany’s new borders with Poland. That simple act—kneeling in humble grief—was widely seen as a major breakthrough in relations between Germany and not just Poland but all of Eastern Europe. Brandt went on to receive the Nobel Peace Prize the following year and Poland erected a statue in his honor not far from the monument where he knelt in silence.

- won’t work for you because that’s not how you’d say it. My hope is that you will respond honestly and authentically in your conversations because that makes for the best exchanges.

- Meditating is simple: sit quietly, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing, while you allow thoughts to pass through your mind without dwelling on them. A thought comes and you notice it and then you let it go, while you return your focus to your breathing. You can count the breaths if you like, but you don’t have to. And that’s it! That’s all that meditation is, at its simplest.

- Meditation simply makes you aware of what the brain is thinking and gives you more control over which thoughts you dwell on and which you choose to release.

- Shift responses are a hallmark of conversational narcissism. They help you turn the focus constantly back to yourself. But a support response encourages the other person to continue their story. It lets them know you’re listening and interested in hearing more.

- It turns out, the more money you have, the less able you are to correctly identify other people’s emotions. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking at photos or interacting with real people, if you’re wealthy, you likely have a harder time recognizing joy, fear, love, and anxiety in a stranger’s face. (You’re also more likely to be rude in conversation, which I think is related to empathy.)6

- In other words, simply thinking of yourself as rich by comparison makes you less empathetic.

- “If you assumed that just because you speak English and the other person speaks English that you’re both speaking the same language, you’re very wrong. The meaning you give to words [is a product of ] your environment and your experience with that word.”

- She just needed to be heard.

- As they say, the mouth shuts, the ears don’t, and there’s a good reason for

- 1.Don’t make it personal. Don’t talk about their personal flaws or use phrases like “This is what you always do” or “Here’s your problem.” 2.Think about solutions instead of focusing only on what you don’t like or what made you angry. A productive argument isn’t just a chance to complain. 3.Be willing to let the other person win. Finding a resolution that helps you both doesn’t always mean declaring a victor or affirming that you are right.

- What do you hope to get out of this exchange? What would you like to have happen at the end and how would you like to walk away from the other person? Angry, frustrated, and no smarter than when you started? You probably cannot change their mind, so perhaps your goal should be your own enlightenment. You can’t control what they take away from the conversation, but you can control what you get out of it.

- you enter every conversation assuming you have something to learn, you will never be disappointed. If you want to articulate your opinion, write a blog. If you want to have a conversation, set your opinions aside, at least temporarily.

- Are they interjecting with “uh-huh” and “yes” to encourage you to reach the end of your sentence? These are signs that the other person’s focus has been exhausted.

- Keeping it brief demonstrates consideration for your conversation partner. They may be too polite or concerned for your feelings to interrupt you or step away from you. Return their courtesy by not abusing their time and patience.

- “It sounds like you had a wonderful time. Usually, I would really enjoy hearing about it, but my brain is barely functioning right now. Please forgive me, but I just want to close my eyes and try to get some rest. Is that all right?” Obviously, she agreed and I enjoyed silence for the rest of the trip. As we left the plane, I asked to see a picture of her grandkids and thanked her, sincerely, for allowing me to relax.

- “I’m cranky and no fun to be around right now. Could you oblige me with silence? I know it’s not fair, but I just want to stew in my own cranky juices.” His response? “Whatever, Mom.”

- But most of our conversations don’t fit that category. In general, it’s helpful to know what you want to say before you start, and then keep an eye on the clock as you talk. In the majority of cases, keeping it short will keep it good. And before this becomes ironic, I’ll keep this chapter short as well.

- Repetition is often boring, unnecessary, and counterproductive. It seems to be most effective as a memory aid for the speaker and not the listener, and that’s why it’s often a conversation killer. The only way to make sure you’re not teaching people to tune you out is to pay attention to what you’re saying. Listen to yourself first. You may

- There’s an old trick that reporters use to get people to say interesting things. We start our questions with one of six words: who, what, where, when, why, and how.

- “What was it like to be so close to the eye of a tornado?”

- make a conscious effort to use this tactic on a daily basis, outside of the radio studio.

- “What’s your biggest weakness?” “Where do you see yourself in five years?” “Why do you want this job?” Those questions are open-ended, but very few applicants will answer them honestly. (For the record, “How does/did that make you feel?” is also a terrible question. It may be open-ended, but it’s become so cliché that it’s been vacated of any meaning.)

- that our questions are just as important as our answers.”

- Sincere questions can even open up conversation with those people who don’t like us very much. Social psychologist Robert Cialdini wrote a book called Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. He has two suggestions for winning over a person who dislikes you: give honest compliments and ask for advice. Ask questions! Ask what book they’d recommend, ask how they would handle a particular situation at work. Ask if they have a favorite vacation spot or ask what kind of gift you should buy for a twelve-year-old nephew.

- Using open-ended questions is a discipline that takes practice. Not every question can begin with “who,” “what,” “where,” “why,” “when,” and “how.” I strive to begin about half of my questions that way, and even that is sometimes a struggle. But the quality of the response you receive after a good, open-ended question is immediately noticeable.

- To be perfectly clear, reading the first couple of paragraphs of an article that someone posted on Facebook is not the same as “knowing” something to be true.

- In Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s book Think Like a Freak, there’s a chapter called “The Three Hardest Words in the English Language.” You might think those words are “I love you,” but the authors argue that those words are actually “I don’t know.”

- I would take this conclusion one step further. When you pretend that you know something you don’t, you not only limit your potential, you also risk taking advantage of someone’s trust in you.

- “but they want to feel like you’re doing your best for them. That comes when you say ‘I don’t know—but I’ll find out.’”

- You will find that the more open you are about the limitations of your knowledge, the more weight people will give to your opinion when you offer it. If you don’t know something, just say “I don’t know.” Those three words can strengthen the bond between you and another person. And just as important, they are a gateway to further exploration and growth. You can’t learn unless you admit that you have something to learn.

- The business psychiatrist Mark Goulston says we only have about forty seconds to speak during a conversation before we run the risk of dominating the exchange. He describes the first twenty seconds as the green light, when the other person likes you and is enjoying what you have to say.

- If it’s trivial, a correction is not necessary. No one needs to interrupt a story about dinner in order to explain that real champagne only comes from France.

- The next time you find yourself providing a lot of detail about a personal matter, take a close look at the other person’s face. Are they looking at something else besides you? Are they stifling a yawn? If so, they may be trying to escape. Forget about what year you bought your first Toyota and move the story along. Your friends, family, coworkers, baristas, and cashiers will thank you.
