# Chaos Monkeys

- don’t need with money you likely don’t have. In the former

- people don’t really change, they just become better actors.

- We would post on Tuesday, which left the most time for a PR blowup to echo across the Internet, and across all levels of Internet connectedness, from the assimilated Internet cyborg to the grandmother in

- MRM, that resourceful savior among engineers, could probably get Linux running on a toaster oven if necessary.

- “chaos monkey” from time to time. This was a software tool created and open-sourced by Netflix, meant to test a product or website’s resiliency against random server failures (such as we’d just witnessed with the blog).

- One quick way to cut through the shit: ask your pretender-to-influence, “Do you have decision-making power?” If he or she even remotely hesitates or hedges, you’re speaking to a lackey (whether he or she acts like one or not). His or her only utility is to get you to the person who does have that power; everything else is so much pig swill.

- Sun Tzu informs us, no matter how cowardly by nature, anyone fights to the death when his back is against the wall. A wise combatant always allows his opponent a way out, something Murthy in his maniacal pursuit of us hadn’t provided.

- So long as you maintain unit cohesion and a shared sense of purpose, and have the basic rudiments of living, you will outlast, outfight, and out-rage any company that sets out to destroy you. Men with nothing to lose will stop at nothing to win.

- Incidentally, it helps to have enemies. While love is a beautiful emotion, far more empires have been built, books written, wrongs righted, fights won, and ambitions realized out of vengeful desire to prove some critic wrong, or existential dread of some perceived enemy, than all the love in the world. Love is grand, but hate and fear last longer.

- Walking into any meeting, you should know every goddamn thing there is to know about the other person; if you don’t, you’re failing. Quoth Emerson and the intro screen to Mortal Kombat 3: “There is no knowledge that is not power,” and that’s especially true in terms of people. That means a combined Facebook-Twitter-LinkedIn stalk at least. You should have done that on all the players in your space already, incidentally. Read between the lines of their idealized and cosmetically enhanced CVs: less than a year at a company means they didn’t vest their first year of equity, which means either they or the company sucked, possibly both. Leaving at precisely four years means they’re plodders, punching the equivalent of the white-collar Silicon Valley clock until the next shift.

- The ones who could pass for a homeless person, though, those are the startup kamikazes who will give everything for the entrepreneurial cause, and are stopped only by death or jail.

- Always be closing, motherfucker.

- One founder was Elad Gil, a YC investor and noted blogger, whose eloquent and knowledgeable takes on the early-stage startup game I routinely devoured.

- Othman Laraki, a former Google product manager who was then a member of the Twitter Growth team.

- entire region. A local startup like Airbnb takes off, and real estate values in Barcelona and Berlin get roiled. The two-century-old bourgeois fortunes of those cities, having survived both Generalísimo Franco and the US Army Air Force Bomber Command, get kicked around by a bunch of scheming geeks and designers housed in an expensively renovated former factory. If a local app like Uber makes it big, taxi drivers in Paris and Mexico City will be rioting and sending bricks through cars’ windshields. If Uber wins, Madrid taxi drivers’ wives will be weeping and wondering what’s for dinner. This was the major-league, serious shit, take-no-prisoners championship of tech entrepreneurship, and if you were going to play, you’d better show up ready to bite the ass off of a bear.*

- If you can only be good at one thing, be good at lying ... because if you’re good at lying, you’re good at everything. —@gselevator,

- When you get the interview-day invite from whatever admin is managing the logistics, make sure to ask for the interviewer list the day before, so you can do the good librarian’s son homework you should be doing, which is stalking each and every interviewer.

- plug for the quantitative sciences: The reality is, most humans manage to feed, clothe, and amuse themselves, and yet are not able to formulate a rational argument that stands up to informed scrutiny, derive the conclusion of a syllogistic argument, or understand a mathematical proof. Doing advanced studies in any quantitative field is like surviving Marine boot camp while the rest of the world is channel surfing and inhaling Oreos; you don’t exactly need to fear the push-up test. Even when the intellectual test is being doled out as filter to the elite ranks of a globe-spanning tech company, you won’t be out of your league if you understand the problem space. So if nothing else, aspiring physicist or mathematician, rest comfortable knowing you’ll come out of that long academic tunnel thinking circles around most people.

- $1.99 spotted digital cows. Facebook got Cuban old ladies to play computer games! And pay for it! Think of that miracle for a moment. And it wasn’t just Cuban old ladies.

- was on its way to full-on Google levels of employee pampering,

- Everyone on the Ads team seemed to have been vetted for Facebook acceptability and values, but nobody (other than perhaps the aforementioned former Googlers) had any notion of what the outside ads world was like. What was weirder, everyone seemed absolutely cool with that. They didn’t know what they
