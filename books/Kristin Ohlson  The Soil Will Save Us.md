# Kristin Ohlson  The Soil Will Save Us
- One of the principles I took away was that bare land starves the microbes below the soil. These microbes need living or dead plants to get their foods—their sugars, carbohydrates, and proteins. They’d prefer a thick and diverse clump of growing plants—roots in the ground!—but dried-up biomass will keep them going until the juicy stuff returns. Thus the idea for raking leaves over the top of my naked lawn. Maybe if I give my microbes dead leaves to chew over the winter and into next spring, they’ll thrive and begin to aerate the lawn themselves as they burrow through the soil and spread their dark constellations underground. Maybe the lawn will then be more receptive to seed and water next spring.
