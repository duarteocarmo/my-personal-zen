# The Programmers Brain
- All unfamiliar code is confusing to a certain extent, but not all code is confusing in the same way. Let’s illustrate that with three different code examples. All three examples translate a given number N or n to binary. The first program is written in APL, the second one in Java, and the third one in BASIC.
- The example in listing 1.1 is a program converting the number n into a binary representation in APL. The confusion here lies in the fact that you might not know what T means. Unless you are a mathematician from the 1960s, you’ve probably never used
- The example in listing 1.1 is a program converting the number n into a binary representation in APL. The confusion here lies in the fact that you might not know what T means. Unless you are a mathematician from the 1960s, you’ve probably never used APL (a programming language). It was designed specifically for mathematical operations and is hardly in use anywhere today.
- He looked at how often developers were interrupted by emails and colleagues (which was a lot!), but he also examined what happens after an interruption. Parnin determined that interruptions are, unsurprisingly, quite disruptive to productivity. The study showed that it typically takes about a quarter of an hour to get back to editing code after an interruption. When interrupted during an edit of a method, programmers were able to resume their work in less than a minute in only 10% of cases.
