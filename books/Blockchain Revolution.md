# Blockchain Revolution

- Satoshi capped the supply of bitcoins at 21 million to be issued over time to prevent arbitrary inflation.

- No hyperinflation or currency devaluation caused by incompetent or corrupt bureaucracies.

- “PayPal can do a real-time credit score in milliseconds, based on your eBay purchase history—and it turns out that’s a better source of information than the stuff used to generate your FICO score.”

- (To save you from doing the math, if the pizza costs $5 when $1 was equal to 2,500 bitcoins, that would be worth $3.5 million as of the writing of this book... but we digress.)

- Google’s promise to “Do No Evil” is not going to be good enough.

- “know your customer,” “anti–money laundering,” and “anti–terrorism financing” regulations.22

- Nike might like to know what you ate for breakfast, how often you go for a run, and whether you are thinking of buying new workout gear. Why not contract that data in exchange for Nike points or real money? Let’s go one step further: Insurance companies are searching for the best data to make actuarial calculations. Your own data—how much you exercise, if you smoke, what you eat—are very valuable to them. Enter into a licensing agreement where every time they use your data to make an actuarial calculation and price a new product, you get a micropayment.33

- When particular aid is delivered—say, vaccinations from the Red Cross or school supplies by UNICEF—those “transactions” can be time-stamped on the ledger. This would reduce or perhaps prevent aid groups accidentally double spending on particular people or communities, thus spreading the benefits of aid more equitably.

- UNICEF announced the launch of Unicoin, a digital currency that children can “mine” by submitting an inspirational drawing to the program. The coins are then exchanged for a notepad and pencil.54

- Through smart contracts, funds can be donated into escrow accounts, accessible only by women, say, for accessing food, feminine products, health care, and other essentials. The men can’t take it out of their hands to buy cigarettes or booze, or to gamble, which can be a persistent problem with money from savings or microfinance.

- We need leadership from the institutions in society that can leverage blockchain technology for good, such as aid groups, civil society organizations, companies, and governments, right down to the individuals who are connecting to this vast network.

- We can now achieve two previously seemingly contradictory goals: “more government” through more information and context; and “less government” through providing information and better tools for individual and group decision making and action within that context.

- “With top-notch cryptographic technology, humans become the weakest link in the security chain.”

- Scenario Planning: Building scenarios with simulation and modeling software to project future policy needs and to understand the long-term consequences of decisions. Politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens could assess the potential impacts on a range of factors, ranging from health, to the environment, to the economy.
