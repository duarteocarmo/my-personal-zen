# A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing
- Difficult as the job may be, picking stocks whose earnings grow is the name of the game. Consistent growth not only increases the earnings and dividends of the company but may also increase the multiple that the market is willing to pay for those earnings. Thus, the purchaser of a stock whose earnings begin to grow rapidly has a chance at a potential double benefit—both the earnings and the multiple may increase.
- Rule 2: Never pay more for a stock than its firm foundation of value.
- Rule 1: Buy only companies that are expected to have above-average earnings growth for five or more years.
- Look for growth situations with low price-earnings multiples. If the growth takes place, there’s often a double bonus—both the earnings and the multiple rise, producing large gains. Beware of very high multiple stocks in which future growth is already discounted. If growth doesn’t materialize, losses are doubly heavy—both the earnings and the multiples drop.
- Rule 3: Look for stocks whose stories of anticipated growth are of the kind on which investors can build castles in the air.
