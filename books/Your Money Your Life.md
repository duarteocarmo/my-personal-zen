# Your Money or Your Life

- According to the dictionary, to consume is to “destroy, squander, use up.”

- We earn for their college educations but relinquish the opportunity to spend time with them during their formative years, substituting toys for time.

- After a certain point you will no longer need to earn a living. The only choice in the matter is when and how that point is reached. In some cases that point is reached while you are still alive. It is then called retirement.

- In 1969, at the age of thirty-one, Joe retired from his career on Wall Street—never again to accept money for any of his work. Throughout his life Joe was accustomed to thinking in new ways, and FI thinking was a natural extension of that.

- There is a way to approach life so that when asked, “Your money or your life?” you say, “I’ll take both, thank you.”

- Along with racism and sexism, our society has a form of caste system based on what you do for money. We call that jobism, and it pervades our interactions with one another on the job, in social settings and even at home. Why else would we consider housewives second-class citizens? Or teachers lower status than doctors even though their desk-side manner with struggling students is far better than many doctors’ bedside manner with the ill and dying?

- bottom line is that we think we work to pay the bills—but we spend more than we make on more than we need, which sends us back to work to get the money to spend to get more stuff to . . .

- Where people work less they buy more . . . business is the exchange of goods. Goods are bought only as they meet needs. Needs are filled only as they are felt. They make themselves felt largely in the leisure hours.

- What else would we do with “disposable” income besides dispose of it—we certainly wouldn’t want to keep it around where it would just rot!

- Change seeks different solutions to intractable problems. Transformation asks different questions so that we can see the problems in a new light. Transformation doesn’t just try a new set of solutions to intractable problems, it asks a new set of questions that allows us to see the problems themselves in a new light.

- It is easier to tell our therapist about our sex life than it is to tell our accountant about our finances.

- There’s no joy in that, just as there is no joy in spending money to gain acceptance but never experiencing true intimacy.

- Money is something we choose to trade our life energy for. Our life energy is our allotment of time here on Earth, the hours of precious life available to us. When we go to our jobs we are trading our life energy for money.

- You could even say money equals our life energy.

- Life energy is all we have. It is precious because it is limited and irretrievable and because our choices about how we use it express the meaning and purpose of our time here on Earth.

- You “pay” for money with your time. You choose how to spend it.

- When you are financially independent, the way money functions in your life is determined by you, not by your circumstances.

- Financial Independence is being free of the fog, fear and fanaticism so many of us feel about money.

- The Bottom Line: Figure 2-2 clearly shows that you are actually selling an hour of your life energy for $6, not the apparent $17. Your real hourly wage is $6.

- Keep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life.

- Keep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life.

- Keep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life.

- No judgment—lots of discernment.

- 1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction and value in proportion to life energy spent? 2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose? 3. How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for a living?

- What about you? Are your values and life purpose clear, or are they out of focus, buried under the weight of a lifestyle that doesn’t seem to fit?

- happiness doesn’t come from externals. It comes only from integrating your values with your relationship with money.

- It is a chosen dedication of your life energy to something you believe is more important than your individual little existence.

- This stonecutter looks up with a mixture of pride and resignation and says, “Why, I’m earning a living to take care of my wife and children.” Moving to the third worker, our questioner asks, “And what are you doing?” The third stonecutter looks up, his face shining, and says with reverence, “I’m building a cathedral!” (dedication to a higher purpose).

- 1. Work with your passion, on projects you care deeply about.

- 2. Work with your pain, with people whose pain touches your heart.

- 3. Work with what is at hand, with the opportunities that arise daily for responding to the simple needs of others.

- this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?”

- arguing about the act, but merely about the price.” Money is an extremely compelling measure for all of us—even those dedicated to lofty ends.

- “Which expenses would decrease and which expenses would disappear if I didn’t go to work every day?”

- 1. Of each spending subcategory in your Monthly Tabulation ask Question 1: “Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction and value in proportion to life energy spent?” Mark your answer with a + (or an up arrow), a–(or a down arrow), or a 0. 2. Of each spending subcategory in your Monthly Tabulation ask Question 2: “Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?” Mark your answer with a + (or an up arrow), a–(or a down arrow), or a 0. 3. Of each spending subcategory in your Monthly Tabulation ask Question 3: “How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for a living?” Mark your answer with a + (or an up arrow), a–(or a down arrow), or a 0 and write the estimated change on the Monthly Tabulation. 4. Review and make a list of all subcategories with the–symbol (or down arrow).

- “If you use credit cards instead of cash, you will spend 12 to 18 percent more.”

- Saving money is like building a dam on a river. The water that builds up behind the dam has an increasing amount of potential energy. Allow your life energy (money) to accumulate in a bank account, and you will be ready to power anything from painting your house to reorienting your life.

- unconscious spending habits. ◆It is a feedback

- (“Give me neither poverty nor wealth, but only enough”)

- (meaning to enjoy or have the use of). Now we’re talking ! Frugality is enjoying the virtue of getting good value for every

- Frugality is enjoying the virtue of getting good value for every minute of your life energy and from everything you have the use of.

- To be frugal means to have a high joy-to-stuff ratio. If you get one unit of joy for each material possession, that’s frugal. But if you need ten possessions to even begin registering on the joy meter, you’re missing the point of being alive.

- Frugality, then, is also learning to share, to see the world as “ours” rather than as “theirs” and “mine.”

- Frugality is the Greek notion of the golden mean. Frugality is being efficient in harvesting happiness from the world you live in. Frugality is right-use

- can actually be one of the truest ways to be green. The amount of stuff you buy is strongly correlated with your impact on nature, since less overall spending

- The amount of stuff you buy is strongly correlated with your impact on nature, since less overall spending generally means fewer products purchased—or purchased new—which means fewer environmental costs.

- Stop Trying to Impress Other People

- 1. Don’t Go Shopping

- Living within your means suggests that you wait until you have the money before you buy something.

- If your knee joints are suffering from running shoes that have lost their bounce, it would be cheaper to buy a new pair (on sale) than to have knee surgery.

- In the shorter term, shopping at the corner convenience store can be expensive. Anticipating your needs—that you’ll be wanting evening snacks, that you’ll run out of milk mid-week or that you’ll need paper for your printer—can eliminate running out to the corner store to pick up these items. Instead you can purchase them during your supermarket shopping or on a run to the office supply store. This can result in significant savings.

- Look for telltale signs that a house isn’t currently occupied (such as an untended yard or uncollected mail or leaflets), find the owner through the tax office and make it easy for him/her to want to rent their property to you.

- If your child is resistant, you might want to give that child a larger-than-normal allowance—but explain that this fund will now have to pay for clothing and other essentials. Many FIers have reported that as soon as their children realized they would have to spend their own money for the stuff they wanted, they became frugal and entrepreneurial quite quickly.

- CHECKLIST: THINK BEFORE YOU SPEND  1. Don’t go shopping. 2. Live within your means. 3. Take care of what you have. 4. Wear it out. 5. Do it yourself. 6. Anticipate your needs. 7. Research value, quality, durability, multiple use and price. 8. Buy it for less. 9. Meet your needs differently. 10. Follow the steps of this program.

- Everybody, rich or poor, must work three hours a day in order to produce only the extreme necessities of life . . . work three hours a day and live in the luxury of literary wealth and have time to do what is meaningful to us.8

- Arlie Hochschild, in her 2001 book The Time Bind, says that families now have three jobs—work, home and repair of relationships damaged by ever more time at the office.

- more than half of Americans say they would be willing to give up a day’s pay a week for an extra day of free time.

- There are two sides to work. On one side is our need and desire for money. We work in order to get paid. On the other side, and totally separate from our wages, is the fact that we work in order to fulfill many other purposes in our lives.

- paid employment is getting paid and that your real “work” may be far bigger than this one job.

- No, don’t just say “working” for those eight hours on your job. More likely you’re writing or thinking or cleaning or driving or speaking or walking or standing or lifting or sitting or listening or deciding or looking for something or . . . the same kinds of things you do the rest of the day.

- Retirement symbolizes the end of life only if you take your self-definition from your paid employment.

- Redefining work gives us back the full experience and expression of these other activities. We can honor our household duties, our relationships and our inner work and give this unpaid employment the same creativity, respect and attention that we give to our paid employment.

- Leisure is not an identity crisis if you know you are not your job.

- Work for many of us is an easy and acceptable way to fill the hours. In our professional lives we have clear rules to follow and goals to meet. By contrast, it is completely up to us to invent the success framework for our leisure.

- Would you do this work the way you are doing it if your financial needs were handled? If not, what adjustments are you making because you need the income? Are you able to stay true to your own integrity? As long as you are receiving money for the work you do, there is the possibility, however minute and subtle, of selling out your vision, your values or your beliefs.

- “Commercialism” destroyed the apes as artists and got them scrambling for a peanut instead.

- Is your teaching what it would be if you weren’t doing it as paid employment?

- “My job is not the main event of my life.”

- Now that you know that your life is bigger than your job, it makes sense to get a job that really “does the job”—i.e., pays you well.

- it makes sense to be sure that your paid employment pays you enough to make your investment of time worth it. This leads to Step 7 of the FI program.

- Enough is not the minimum amount for survival; it is the exact amount that gives you fulfillment without excess.

- Unlike the behavior of a workaholic, however, working extra hours is now connected with and serves your purpose.

- You want more money so that you can have enough material possessions and more life.

- You want more money so that you can have more freedom to be yourself without worrying about the money.

- You want more money as an expression of your self-esteem, of valuing your life energy.

- To be successful, cultivate positive attitudes of self-respect, pride in your contribution to your workplace, dedication to your job, cooperation with your employers and coworkers, desire to do the job right, personal integrity, responsibility and accountability—and do it just because you value your life energy.

- You value your life energy because you value life. You are committed to excellence at your job because you’re committed to 100 percent integrity, no matter what you’re doing.

- (You might be be surprised at how many artists, writers, activists and adventurers you find among seasonal workers.)

- In order to find a high-integrity, high-paying job, you must have a clear purpose for having one.

- Intention is the will to meet your goal or achieve your purpose.

- Step 7 is simply “valuing your life energy and increasing your income”—since the only purpose of paid employment is getting paid. You do this not out of greed or competition but out of self-respect and an appreciation of life.

- Savings are funds put aside from time to time and kept unexpended. You are usually saving for something, if only a rainy day. Capital, however, is money that makes more money. Capital is money that keeps working for you, that produces an income as surely as your job produces income.

- An investment is the conversion of capital into some form of wealth other than cash with the expectation of deriving income.

- Each month, apply the following formula to your total accumulated capital and record the result on your Wall Chart:

- The Crossover Point provides us with our final definition of Financial Independence. At the Crossover Point, where monthly investment income crosses above monthly expenses, you will be financially independent in the traditional sense of that term. You will have a safe, steady income for life from a source other than a job.

- One of the cornerstones of this program, for those wishing to go all the way to Financial Independence, is concentrating on making money now so that you don’t have to make money later. You are thus committing yourself to intensively earning money (without selling out your integrity or endangering your health) for a limited period of time.

- No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.

- You can use them to help you when you have decided what you want to buy, but be wary of securities brokers if you’re looking for investment advice. Also keep in mind that they get you “coming and going”—they make commissions both when you buy and when you sell—regardless if you have made a profit.

- who work for a fee, not for commissions on products. Be sure to hire a “fee

- Be sure to hire a “fee only” consultant.

- The financially intelligent shopper (that’s you, if you’ve applied the smart shopping tips in Chapter 6 plus your own even-more-clever strategies) switches to apple juice. The CPI does not make the same rational adjustments.

- The ultimate return on any long-term investment is determined by four primary factors: the annual rate of return, fees, taxes and the effects of inflation over time.

- As an FIer, you don’t want to risk your nest egg. But you are already putting the value of your nest egg at risk if your investment returns don’t at least keep pace with inflation.

- Note: Citizens of countries other than the United States should investigate their own nation’s government bonds. While it is possible to buy U.S. treasury bonds almost anywhere in the world, the fluctuations in currency exchange rates make the interest income payments unpredictable, which would only be appropriate for more adventurous FI investors.

- Recall that FI1 is Financial Intelligence, the marketplace savvy that makes your money go as far as possible. FI2 is Financial Integrity, aligning your earning and spending with your values and true fulfillment. FI3 is Financial Independence, which here is used to mean having enough income from investments to meet your needs now and in the future.

- CHECKLIST OF THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN INVESTING  1. Is this investment in line with my values? 2. What are the federal, state and local tax implications of this investment for me? (Is it tax efficient for my income bracket or situation?) 3. How easily can I liquidate (sell out of) all or part of this investment? 4. What sales charges/penalties (if any) will I incur in getting into or out of this investment? 5. Does this provide the current/future income I need? 6. Does this provide overall diversification for my investments? 7. Is this investment in line with my tolerance for risk?

- Charging below-market rates ensures that I get an excellent return on my investment combined with the pleasure of knowing others are flourishing within those four walls.

- In Conclusion You are well on your way to taking back the power you have given over to money—and to money “experts.” You are ready to become a conscientious, loving and knowledgeable steward of your life energy. Our greatest hope is that you will apply these steps to your own finances and apply your life energy to the challenges that face our species and our planet. We wish you great success.
